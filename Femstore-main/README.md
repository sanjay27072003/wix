# Femstore
##Built with Velo
## Inspiration💡
We got inspiration from some female-run NGOs here in India. They are actively contributing much to this society and empowering women. Furthermore, we observed many of them produce many products on their own and sell them. So we thought it would be a great idea if we could provide a common platform for all of them to showcase their products so that it will be easy for them and also for those who wanna buy female/women-made products.

## What it doesw👯‍♀️
This website is used to sell products made by women and for women. Apart from that, this website acts as a platform to start conversations between users and female manufacturers or sellers. Furthermore, there are many blog pages and forums on the site to discuss with other women empowerment activists. And we made an android version of our site/company.

## Challenges we ran into 🧗✨
 1. It was not easy to get started with Velo by Wix, and it did not have a collaboration option where the team members could join, design, and develop the website.
 2. We did not have a premium/subscribed account
